1) find mediean in sorted but different size of arrays -> DONE

2) having sorted array with n size all the values are unique but 1 value is duplicate, find that duplicate value..

3) having sorted array with n size all the values are duplicate but 1 value is unique, find that unique value.. -> PSEUDO

4) having a sorted infinate array ( lenght/size is unknown (can't use lenght property of array)) some few values of 
array is 0's after that all are 1's find the first position of 1
i.e [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1] -> JUST PSEUDO

5)having a sorted infinate array ( lenght/size is unknown (can't use lenght property of array)) some few values of 
array is -val after that all are +post find the first position of +val
i.e [-10,-7,-4,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,6,8,9,10,20] -> DONE

6) Find the smallest and second smallest element in the array using minimum number of comparsions
7) Find the minimum element in a sorted and rotated array -> DONE
8) Find Kth largest element in an array -> will soon
9) Find Kth smallest element in an array -> will soon
10) Find the middle element among three numbers
11) Find median of k sorted arrays 

12) Find the index of first 1 in an infinite sorted array of 0s and 1s
13) Find the point where a monotonically increasing function becomes positive first time
14) Search an element in a sorted and rotated array
15) Find the maximum element in an array which is first increasing and then decreasing
16) Find the first and last occurrence of a number in a sorted array

Ans of above question number is 3) by using XOR operator (if we have un-sorted list) -> DONE

3) find repeating & missing number into arrays
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTkoJOP6m6w => DONE

remove duplicate value into sorted array
4) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf7vdIin0dk


5) Reverse linked list in the blocks -> DONE
i.e 1->2->3->4-5->6->7->8->9->109

reverse block count is x = 4

4->3->2->1->8->7->6->5->10->9

head will point at 4

6) merge two sorted arrays with the same size without taking extra space. TC should be in  O(n)
first array size would be like 9/10(even or odd)
second array size would also be as same as first array but both array would fill partially 
i.e array1 size = 5 [4,6,7] array2 size = 5 [10,11] 
So array1 can be placed into array2 or array2 can be placed into array1 into sorted manner
by using two-way merging by start array scanning from backward.....    DONE

7) multiply strings
