8) Given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.
	For example, given A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5.
	Given A = [1, 2, 3], the function should return 4.
	Given A = [−1, −3], the function should return 1. =>  DONE

24) Finding Celebrity Puzzle : In a party on N people, There is celebrity. A celebrity is a person who knows nobody but is known 
	by everyone else. The task is to identify a celebrity by only asking questions to people present in the party : 
	Does person A know B? Design a strategy to find the celebrity in minimum number of questions or determine that the group has no 
	such person.
